# Edulab

Welcome to Edulab, a 2D physics simulation software developed to bridge the gap between complex physics concepts and those new to the subject.

**Disclaimer**: Though the first version of the software is complete this is still work in progress! Have that in mind while exporing and don't be afraid to open an issue if you 
spot that something is wrong. Thanks!


## How to install?

I do not provide binaries so you have to complile the program from source. Here is a quick guide on how to do it.

1. Get the dependencies: In CMakeLists.txt there are libraries listed that you need for the software to work.
    You have to install them on your computer.

2. Use cmake command: After the execution, in chosen directory build files will appear.
3. Build: Depending on platform that you are on the process will be different. For now the process is tested on
   ```make``` tool with Unix based systems.
